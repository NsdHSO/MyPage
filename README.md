# MyPage
This is my main presentation web pages

I wanted to realize the CRUD concept (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\n
PERN tools (Postgres, Express, React, Nodejs)
Through this project I wanted to learn to work with databases (postgresql).
On the client side I worked with react, on the server side I worked with nodejs / express.
I also worked with Postman.
